# Changelog

## [v0.3.0] - 2023-11-19

- Updated to new Lerna defaults, see [Lerna v7 changelog](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes)
- Optimized caching by ignoring nested workspace roots.  
  Most tools already error when trying to use a nested workspace root, so this should not be a breaking change.

## [v0.2.0] - 2023-06-10

- Now ignores workspaces that do not have a `name` property defined in their `package.json` file
- Replaced `type-fest` with `pkg-types` for the `package.json` type definitions
